# Creating a DAG With BashOperator

This repository demonstrates how to build an Apache Airflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using the BashOperator. The project is written entirely in Python and serves as a simple example for orchestrating shell commands within Airflow workflows.

## Overview

Apache Airflow is a platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. The BashOperator allows you to execute bash commands or scripts as part of your pipelines. This repository includes sample DAGs and relevant Python code to help you get started.

## Features

- Example Airflow DAG using the BashOperator
- Clear and well-commented Python code for learning and adaptation
- Step-by-step instructions for running the workflow locally
